I'm a passionate Software Developer 🚀, with valuable experience such as an interning at Amazon and Salesforce as a SDE Intern, I've honed my skills and gained invaluable insights into the tech industry.

I thrive in hackathons as they fuel my creativity and drive to push boundaries. Constantly seeking opportunities to learn and grow. Beyond coding, I'm fueled by a love for sports 🏀⚽, which has instilled in me the importance of teamwork, resilience, and discipline. These qualities have played a vital role in shaping my professional journey, allowing me to embrace challenges with determination.
